# Some ideas for the portfolio:

- Make a functional web server that listens on ports 80 and 443 (TLS) and serves static files.
- The portfolio blog pages should be .md files that are converted to HTML.
- Have a page that plays an emulator of the CHIP-8 virtual machine (Rust with WASM) with an option to upload and run a ROM file.
